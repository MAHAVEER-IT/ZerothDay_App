# Google Logo Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the Google logo image. 

To complete the setup:
1. Download the official Google logo from Google's brand resources
2. Save it as "google_logo.png" in this directory
3. Alternatively, you can use any appropriate Google sign-in icon

The login screen will fall back to a generic login icon if this image is not found.
